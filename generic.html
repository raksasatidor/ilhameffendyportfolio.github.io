								<p>As a Data Engineer Intern at SLB, I have the opportunity to work with their advanced technology and real-world oil and gas data. This exposure has fueled my eagerness to learn new skills and broaden my knowledge. I have also had the chance to contribute to both internal projects and external that benefit my team.

								<p>During my internship as an IT Support Intern, I was actively involved in a variety of technical support and infrastructure-related tasks. My responsibilities included providing end-to-end support for workstations, such as formatting PCs, installing and configuring essential software, troubleshooting hardware-related issues, and preparing new laptops for deployment to end users.</p>
								<p>I also contributed to network support operations by assisting in troubleshooting network issues, monitoring network performance, and participating in project-based activities to enhance the organization's IT infrastructure. This gave me valuable exposure to real-world networking environments and tools.</p>
								<p>I supported the compliance team in handling virus incidents, conducting internal audits, and generating detailed reports to ensure IT operations adhered to security policies and standards.</p>
								<p>As part of the helpdesk team, I provided daily technical support to staff, including reinstalling Office 365, resolving user issues, and addressing common system errors. This role strengthened my problem-solving skills and improved my ability to communicate technical solutions effectively to non-technical users.</p>
								<p>	Overall, this internship allowed me to develop a solid foundation in IT support while gaining practical experience in both hardware and software troubleshooting, network management, and compliance support.</p>
